The advantages for a team playing at home or away are based on several factors that influence the probabilities of winning, drawing, or losing. Here are the typical advantages:

## Advantages for a Team Playing at Home:
- Familiarity with the Field:

The home team is accustomed to the pitch, its dimensions, and conditions, which can give them a tactical edge.
- Support from Home Fans:

The presence of home supporters can boost morale and motivation, often referred to as the "12th man" effect.
- Reduced Travel Fatigue:

The home team avoids the physical and mental fatigue associated with traveling to an away venue.
- Psychological Advantage:

Playing in a familiar environment can reduce stress and increase confidence.
- Referee Bias:

Studies have shown that referees may subconsciously favor the home team in close decisions due to crowd pressure.

## Disadvantages for a Team Playing Away:
- Unfamiliar Environment:

The away team may not be used to the pitch conditions, lighting, or weather at the venue.
- Hostile Crowd:

The away team may face intimidation or distraction from the home crowd.
- Travel Fatigue:

Long-distance travel can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, affecting performance.
- Reduced Confidence:

Playing in an unfamiliar or hostile environment can lead to a lack of confidence.
- Time Zone Differences:

For international matches, time zone changes can disrupt the away team's routine and performance.

##How These Factors Translate to Probabilities:
- Home Advantage: Typically, the home team's win probability is increased by a certain percentage (e.g., 10-20%), while the away team's win probability is decreased.
- Away Disadvantage: The away team's win probability is reduced, and the likelihood of a draw may increase slightly.

In your code, these factors are represented by the home_advantage and away_advantage parameters in the adjust_probs_for_home_away function. For example:

- A positive home_advantage increases the home team's win probability.
- A negative away_advantage decreases the away team's win probability.

These adjustments are then normalized to ensure the probabilities sum to 1, reflecting the real-world dynamics of home and away matches.
